<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Most people tend to communicate in an indirect manner.  For example, if you ask someone a question, their answer may not only depend on the objective reality, but also on the nature of the question, social circumstances, and their relationship to you.</li>
  <li>People will almost never say "I don&#39;t know" because they don&#39;t want to sound unfriendly/unhelpful. Often times, people will tell what they think you&#39;d most like to hear. </li>
  <li>Most Hondurans prefer standing a little less than an arm&#39;s length apart during conversations.  This distance may be less between good friends and family.</li>
  <li>On buses and other forms of public transport people sit very close to each other and those standing are often crammed in with little to no personal space between them.</li>
  <li>Many people point by turning their head and pursing out their lips in the direction of the object they are pointing at.

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Table Manners </h2>
<ul>

  <li>Dining with others in Honduras is all about the socialization aspect of the event, so be sure to be ready for conversation. Generally, the Hondurans arrive to meals quite late, arriving 30 minutes late is not unusual and some people will show up 45 minutes late.</li>
 <li>Once everyone arrives, drinks are usually served prior to eating, something to help prevent a dry throat from all the talking. This generally begins with a toast of "salud" then followed by drinking and lively conversation. </li>
  <li> Your host will eventually invite you to the table, but let him or her seat you and expect to be separated from your significant other if eating together; this encourages meeting new people and greater socialization.</li>
  <li>Generally the men and women will eat on opposite sides of the table, and this sexual division continues in other ways as men are expected to stand when women enter the room.</li>
  <li>With the arrival of the food, the host will generally invite everyone to begin eating with the words "buen provecho." Although the Hondurans are fairly forgiving in foreign dining habits that differ from their own, they do expect you to keep your hands in sight by resting your wrists on the table and if possible you should eat in the continental style (fork in the left hand and knife in the right).  </li>
  <li>If dining in a local&#39;s home, take small amounts of food at first, so you can ask for a second helping (this is a great compliment to your host). As you finish eating, eat all the food from your plate, then place the knife and fork together on the right side of the plate. </li>

</ul>


<a id="Misc"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Views of Time</h3>
<ul>
  <li>One of the most famous necessary adjustments for any traveler, student, or expat is getting used to a new concept of punctuality.  If something happens the day that it&#39;s planned, then things are going pretty well.  If you ask when a bus is going to arrive, 9 times out of 10 people will say "ya viene" which means "It&#39;s coming already" and could mean anything from 5 minutes to 3 hours.</li>
  <li>Another good example of this is the meaning of the word "ahora" which literally means "now", but is often replaced by "hoy" which means "today". </li>
  <li>In most business or social situations, people tend to like to take the time necessary to do whatever they&#39;re doing rather than think about finishing within a certain time frame, and people are almost always happy to sacrifice some of their time to talk to you.

</li>


</ul>
