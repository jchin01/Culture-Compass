<a id="Communication"></a>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In general, communication is moderately indirect perhaps reflecting an amalgamation of both North American and British tendencies. Although most Canadians can disagree openly when necessary, they prefer to do so with tact and diplomacy. Their communication style is essentially pragmatic and relies on common sense. If you come from a culture where communication is very direct, you may wish to relax your demeanour and tone so as not to appear threatening.
</li>

  <li> Communication styles vary most between Anglophone and Francophone parts of the country. Francophones are generally more indirect than Anglophones, although less so than the French. They also tend to be more exuberant than Anglophones. Anglophones do not generally interrupt someone who is speaking. They consider it rude not to let a person complete their thought before entering the discussion. Francophones are more likely to interrupt another speaker.</li>

  <li>Canadians communicate more by the spoken word rather than non-verbal expressions. Non-verbal expressions are only really used to add emphasis to a message or are part of an individual&#39;s personal communication style.
</li>
  <li>Canadians like their personal space and prefer to be at an armâ€™s length when speaking to someone.
</li>
  <li>They expect people to speak in a straightforward manner and to be able to back up their claims with examples. They do not make exaggerated claims and are suspicious of something that sounds too good to be true.
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Table Manners </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Table manners are relatively relaxed and informal in Canada. Quebec does have a little more formality.
</li>
  <li>Table cutlery manners are generally Continental, i.e. the fork is held in the left hand and the knife in the right while eating. The tines of the fork should face down.
</li>
  <li>Do not begin eating until the hostess starts.
</li>
  <li>Do not rest your elbows on the table.
</li>
  <li>Leaving a small amount at the end of the meal is generally acceptable.
</li>
  <li>In formal situations, the host gives the first toast. An honoured guest should return the toast later in the meal. Women may give toasts.
</li>

</ul>


<a id="Misc"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Gifts</h3>
<ul>

  <li>If invited to someone&#39;s home for dinner, take a box of good chocolates, flowers or a bottle of wine.</li>
  <li>In Quebec, sending flowers in advance of the dinner party is the correct protocol.
</li>
  <li>In Quebec, if you give wine, make sure it is of the highest quality you can afford.
</li>
  <li>Do not give white lilies as they are used at funerals.
</li>
  <li>Do not give cash or money as a present.
</li>
<li>Gifts are usually opened when received.
</li>
</ul>
