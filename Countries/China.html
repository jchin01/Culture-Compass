<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Since the Chinese strive for harmony and are group dependent, they rely on facial expression, tone of voice and posture to tell them what someone feels.</li>
  <li>Frowning while someone is speaking is interpreted as a sign of disagreement. Therefore, most Chinese maintain an impassive expression when speaking.</li>
  <li>It is considered disrespectful to stare into another person&#39;s eyes. In crowded situations the Chinese avoid eye contact to give themselves privacy.</li>
  <li>Greetings are formal and the oldest person is always greeted first.</li>
  <li>Handshakes are the most common form of greeting with foreigners.</li>
  <li>Many Chinese will look towards the ground when greeting someone.</li>
  <li>Address the person by an honorific title and their surname. If they want to move to a first-name basis, they will advise you which name to use.</li>
  <li>The Chinese have a terrific sense of humour. They can laugh at themselves most readily if they have a comfortable relationship with the other person. Be ready to laugh at yourself given the proper circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<a id="TableManners"></a>
<h2>Table Manners </h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Chinese prefer to entertain in public places rather than in their homes, especially when entertaining foreigners.</li>
  <li>If you are invited to their house, consider it a great honour. If you must turn down such an honour, it is considered polite to explain the conflict in your schedule so that your actions are not taken as a slight.</li>
  <li>Arrive on time.</li>
  <li>Remove your shoes before entering the house.</li>
  <li>Bring a small gift to the hostess.</li>
  <li>Eat well to demonstrate that you are enjoying the food!</li>
  <li>Learn to use chopsticks.</li>
  <li>Wait to be told where to sit. The guest of honour will be given a seat facing the door.</li>
  <li>The host begins eating first.</li>
  <li>You should try everything that is offered to you.</li>
  <li>Never eat the last piece from the serving tray.</li>
  <li>Chopsticks should be returned to the chopstick rest after every few bites and when you drink or stop to speak.</li>
  <li>The host offers the first toast.</li>
  <li>Do not put bones in your bowl. Place them on the table or in a special bowl for that purpose.</li>
  <li>Hold the rice bowl close to your mouth while eating.</li>
  <li>Do not be offended if a Chinese person makes slurping or belching sounds; it merely indicates that they are enjoying their food.</li>
  <li>There are no strict rules about finishing all the food in your bowl.</li>
</ul>


<a id="Misc"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Gifts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Chinese like food and a nice food basket will make a great gift.</li>
  <li>Do not give scissors, knives or other cutting utensils as they indicate the severing of the relationship.</li>
  <li>Do not give clocks, handkerchiefs or straw sandals as they are associated with funerals and death.</li>
  <li>Do not give flowers, as many Chinese associate these with funerals.</li>
  <li>Do not wrap gifts in white, blue or black paper.</li>
  <li>Four is an unlucky number so do not give four of anything. Eight is the luckiest number, so giving eight of something brings luck to the recipient.</li>
  <li>Always present gifts with two hands.</li>
  <li>Gifts are not opened when received.</li>
  <li>Gifts may be refused three times before they are accepted.</li>
</ul>
