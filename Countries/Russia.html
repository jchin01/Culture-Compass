<a id="Communication"></a>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When female friends meet, they kiss on the cheek three times starting with the left and alternating cheek.</li>
  <li>The typical greeting is a bone-crushing handshake while maintaining direct eye contact and giving the appropriate greeting for the time of day. Initial greetings may come across as cold.</li>
  <li>Remove your gloves before shaking hands and don&#39;t shake hands over a threshold because Russian folk belief holds that this action will lead to an argument.</li>
  <li>Russians stand close when talking.</li>
  <li>In formal situations, people use all three names. Friends and close acquaintances may refer to each other by their first name and patronymic. Close friends and family members call each other by their first name only.</li>
</ul>

<a id="TableManners"></a>
<h2>Table Manners </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Arrive on time or no more than 15 minutes later than invited. </li>
  <li>Remove your outdoor shoes. You may be given slippers to wear.</li>
  <li>The oldest or most honoured guest is served first. </li>
  <li>Do not begin eating until the host invites you to start.</li>
  <li>Do not rest your elbows on the table, and your hands should be visible at all times. </li>
  <li>Always keep the knife in your right hand, and the fork in your left. Lay the knife and fork parallel to each other on the right side of the plate once done with the meal. </li>
  <li>You will be encouraged to take second helpings and leaving a small amount of food on your plate indicates that your hosts have provided ample hospitality.</li>
  <li>Men pour drinks for women seated next to them.</li>
  <li>Do not get up until you are invited to leave the table. At formal dinners, the guest of honor is the first to get up from the table.</li>
  <li>Offer to help the hostess with the preparation or clearing up after a meal is served. This may be turned down out of politeness. </li>
</ul>


<a id="Misc"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Helpful Hints</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Do not expect to find smoke-free areas anywhere. A standard joke among foreign businesspeople in Russia is that Russian buildings have two sections: "smoking" and "chain-smoking."</li>
  <li>Never refer to a Russian as "Comrade."</li>
  <li>Russians are very proud of their culture and enjoy opportunities to talk about their music, art, literature, and dance. Knowledge about art, music, and some Russian history is appreciated.</li>
  <li>Putting your thumb through your index and middle fingers or making the "OK" sign are considered very rude gestures in Russia.</li>
</ul>
