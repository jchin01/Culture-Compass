<a id="Communication"></a>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In India it&#39;s traditional to greet people using "Namaste" - place both hands together and bow slightly, however, in  urban areas this is often overlooked.</li>
  <li>Men will often also shake hands when meeting or leaving, but they should not attempt to shake hands with women. </li>
  <li>Indian culture is based on a hierarchical system, so elders and superior are greeted first.</li>
  <li>Use your right hand to touch, accept, or give something.</li>
  <li>Do not beckon with your hand or snap your fingers  instead, with your arm extended,  curl your fingers downward in a claw motion.</li>
  <li>Pointing, with either one or two fingers, is considered rude and used for inferiors only while chins, thumbs and entire hands are used to point or direct someone&#39;s attention.</li>
  <li>Feet are considered unclean. Feet are sacred for holy men and women. Pointing footwear at people is considered an insult.</li>
 <li>It is important to limit any public displays of affection because PDA can be seen as offensive especially to the older generations.</li>
</ul>

<a id="TableManners"></a>
<h2>Table Manners </h2>
<ul>
  <li> You may be invited to wash your hands before eating. </li>
  <li>If hosts eat with hands, assure them you enjoy doing the same. If utensils are not used, use your right hand (first three fingers and thumb) to eat.</li>
  <li>Many strict Muslims, and Hindu women, do not drink alcohol.</li>
  <li>Guests are generally served in a hierarchical order: guest of honour, men, then children (women may eat later). </li>
  <li>Try to not use your left hand for eating or talking to people around you. </li>
  <li>A host will always serve their guests. Accept whatever you are offered but don&#39;t feel obliged to finish everything on your plate. </li>
  <li>If food is placed in communal dishes for you to help yourself, always use a spoon. </li>
  <li>In a restaurant, the host will generally pay the bill.</li>
  <li>Arrive 15-30 minutes later than the stated time for a dinner party and take off shoes before entering the person&#39;s home.</li>
  <li>Wait until everyone else is sitting down before starting to eat.</li>
</ul>
