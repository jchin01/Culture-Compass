<a id="Communication"></a>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Saudi communication style is tempered by the need to save face, honour, and follow Sunnah, the example of the Prophet Muhammad.
</li>

  <li>Being rude, causing offence, or looking ungracious is worse than death in Saudi culture, so they will always want to save face, whether their own or someone else.
 </li>

  <li>Saudis tend to say "yes" to everything and "no" to very little especially when dealing with foreigners. However, between themselves and those lower down in hierarchy, they can be very blunt.
</li>
  <li>Emotional outbursts are very rare and point to serious issues if someone loses their temper.
</li>
  <li>It is common especially among good friends or colleagues to see very local arguments with lots of aggressive body language. This is seen as being passionate and involved in the topic at hand as all parties understand it is a charade.
</li>
  <li>Saudis love to flatter guests; this should be taken in the positive and friendly spirit intended and, if possible, returned in kind.
</li>
  <li>It is common to be asked very personal questions about your family or lifestyle; this is not being nosey, but inquisitive.
</li>
</ul>

<a id="TableManners"></a>
<h2>Table Manners </h2>
<ul>
  <li>If the meal is on the floor, sit cross-legged or kneel on one knee. Keep your feet away from the cloth or plastic sheet.
 </li>
  <li>Eat only with the right hand as the left is considered unclean. Ask for a fork if you want one.
</li>
  <li>Try a bit of everything that is served.
</li>
  <li>Honoured guests are often offered the most prized pieces such as a sheep&#39;s head, so be prepared!
</li>
  <li>There is often more food than you can eat. Part of Saudi hospitality and generosity is to shower guests with abundance.
</li>
  <li>There is little conversation during meals so that diners may relish the food.
</li>
  <li>Wash hands before and after meals - all restaurants usually have washing up areas.
</li>

</ul>


<a id="Misc"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Gifts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gifts are common in Saudi Arabia, especially in business and social occasions.
</li>
  <li>If you are invited to a Saudi&#39;s house, always bring something small as a thank you. Dates, cakes, and sweets are always well received. Flowers are a nice touch for the hostess.

</li>
  <li>In business, corporate gifts such as pens, prayer beads, and USB sticks are standard practice.
</li>
  <li>Teachers are often the recipients of many gifts from pupils</li>

</ul>
