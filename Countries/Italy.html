<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Greetings are enthusiastic yet formal.
</li>
  <li>The usual handshake with direct eye contact and a smile suffices between strangers.

 </li>
  <li>Once a relationship develops, air-kissing on both cheeks (starting with the left) is often added as well as a pat on the back between men.
</li>
  <li>Wait until invited to move to a first name basis.
</li>
  <li>Italians are guided by first impressions, so it is important that you demonstrate propriety and respect when greeting people especially when meeting them for the first time.

</li>
  <li>Many Italians use calling cards in social situations. These are slightly larger than traditional business cards and include the person&#39;s name, address, title or academic honours, and their telephone number.
</li>
  <li>If you are staying in Italy for an extended period of time, it is a good idea to have calling cards made. Never give your business card in lieu of a calling card in a social situation.

</li>
</ul>

<a id="TableManners"></a>
<h2>Table manners</h2>
<li>Table manners are Continental -- the fork is held in the left hand and the knife in the right while eating.
</li>
  <li> Follow the lead of the hostess - she sits at the table first, starts eating first, and is the first to get up at the end of the meal.

</li>

  <li>The host gives the first toast.
</li>
<li>An honoured guest should return the toast later in the meal.
</li>
  <li>Always take a small amount at first so you can be cajoled into accepting a second helping.
</li>
  <li>Do not keep your hands in your lap during the meal; however, do not rest your elbows on the table either.

</li>
  <li>It is acceptable to leave a small amount of food on your plate.
</li>
  <li>Pick up cheese with your knife rather than your fingers.
</li>
<li>If you do not want more wine, leave your wine glass nearly full.
</li>
</ul>


<a id="Misc"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Gifts</h3>
<ul>

  <li> Do not give chrysanthemums as they are used at funerals.</li>
  <li>Do not give red flowers as they indicate secrecy. </li>
  <li>Do not give yellow flowers as they indicate jealousy.</li>
  <li>Do not wrap gifts in black as it is traditionally a mourning colour.</li>
<li>If you bring wine, make sure it is a good vintage. Quality rather than quantity is important.</li>

<li>Do not wrap gifts in purple as it is a symbol of bad luck.</li>


  </ul>
