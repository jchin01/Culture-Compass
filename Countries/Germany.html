<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A quick, firm handshake is the traditional greeting.</li>
  <li>Never shake hands with one hand in your pocket. </li>
  <li>Never use the "okay" sign (index finger and thumb jointed together to make a circle). This is considered a rude gesture.</li>
  <li>Don&#39;t point your index finger to your own head. This is an insult.</li>
  <li>Never put your hands in your pockets when talking with someone.</li>
  <li>Don&#39;t lose your temper publicly. This is viewed as uncouth and a sign of weakness.</li>
  <li>Stand when an elder or higher ranked person enters the room.</li>
  <li>Don&#39;t shout, be loud, put your feet on furniture or chew gum in public.</li>
  <li>Titles are very important and denote respect. Use a person&#39;s title and their surname until invited to use their first name. You should say "Herr" or "Frau", the person&#39;s title, and their surname.</li>

</ul>

<a id="TableManners"></a>
<h2>Table Manners </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Remain standing until invited to sit down. You may be shown to a particular seat. </li>
  <li>Table manners are Continental -- the fork is held in the left hand and the knife in the right while eating.</li>
  <li> Do not begin eating until the hostess starts or someone says "guten appetit" (good appetite).</li>
  <li> At a large dinner party, wait for the hostess to place her napkin in her lap before doing so yourself.</li>
  <li>Do not rest your elbows on the table. </li>
  <li>Do not cut lettuce in a salad. Fold it using your knife and fork.</li>
  <li> Cut as much of your food with your fork as possible, since this compliments the cook by indicating the food is tender.</li>
  <li> Finish everything on your plate.</li>
  <li>Rolls should be broken apart by hand.</li>
  <li>Indicate you have finished eating by laying your knife and fork parallel across the right side of your plate with the fork over the knife.</li>
  <li>The host gives the first toast.</li>
  <li>An honoured guest should return the toast later in the meal.</li>
  <li>The most common toast with wine is "Zum Wohl!" ("good health"</li>
  <li>The most common toast with beer is "Prost!" ("good health").</li>
</ul>


<a id="Misc"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Gifts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you are invited to a German&#39;s house, bring a gift such as chocolates or flowers.
</li>
  <li>Yellow roses or tea roses are always well received.</li>
  <li>Do not give red roses as they symbolize romantic intentions.</li>
  <li>Do not give lilies or chrysanthemums as they are used at funerals.</li>
  <li>Gifts are usually opened when received.</li>
</ul>
