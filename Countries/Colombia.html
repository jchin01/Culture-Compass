<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Men shake hands with direct eye contact. Women often grasp forearms rather than shaking hands.

</li>
  <li>While shaking hands, use the appropriate greeting for the time of day: "buenos dias" (good day), "buenas tardes" (good afternoon), or "buenas noches" (good evening/night).
</li>
  <li>Once a friendship has developed, greetings become warmer and a lot more hands on - men will embrace and pat each other on the shoulder (known as an "abrazo") and women kiss once on the right cheek.
 </li>
  <li>The father&#39;s surname is listed first and is the one used in conversation.
</li>
  <li>Always refer to people by the appropriate honorific title and their surname.
</li>

</ul>

<a id="TableManners"></a>
<h2>Table Manners </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Wait to be seated by the host.</li>
  <li>Hands should be kept visible when eating. Do not rest elbows on the table.

</li>
  <li> The host will say "buen provecho" (enjoy or have a good meal) as an invitation to start eating.
</li>
  <li>It is polite to try everything you are given.
</li>
  <li>Do not use a toothpick at the table.
</li>
</ul>


<a id="Misc"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Gifts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When going to a Colombian&#39;s home, bring fruit, a potted plant, or quality chocolates for the hostess.
</li>
  <li>Flowers should be sent in advance.
</li>
  <li>Do not give lilies or marigolds as they are used at funerals. Roses are liked.
</li>

</li>
  <li>Wrapped gifts are not opened when received.
</li>
</ul>
