<a id="Communication"></a>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Take time to greet and say good-bye to each person present.

</li>
<li>Women generally kiss each other, starting with the left and alternating cheeks.</li>
<li>Women kiss twice -- once on each cheek -- if they are married. Single women add a third kiss.
</li>
 <li>Physical contact is part of simple communication. Touching arms, elbows and backs is very common and acceptable. Brazilians also stand extremely close to one another. Do not back away.

</li>
 <li>The  "O.K." sign is considered very rude and vulgar; the "thumbs up" gesture is used for approval.
</li>
 <li>Wiping your hands together means "it doesnâ€™t matter."
</li>
 <li>Clicking the tongue and shaking the head indicates disagreement or disapproval.

</li>
 <li>Don&#39;t refer to Brazilians as Latins.
</li>
<li>Hugging and backslapping are common greetings among Brazilian friends.</li>
 <li>If a woman wishes to shake hands with a man, she should extend her hand first.</li>
</ul>

<a id="TableManners"></a>
<h2>Table Manners </h2>
<ul>
 <li> Brazilians always wash their hands before eating and rarely touch food with their hands. Use a knife and fork for everything, even fruit. Always use a napkin while eating or drinking.

</li>
 <li>When inviting Brazilians to dinner or a party, do not suggest that your guests bring food or drink. Do not expect them to arrive on time, and never indicate a time that the party will "end."
</li>
 <li> To beckon a waiter, hold up the index finger of your right hand and quietly say "Gar&ccedil;on." To request the check, say "A conta, por favor." Waiters generally don&#39;t bring checks until they are requested.
</li>
 <li> Brazilians dress with a flair and judge others on their appearance. Casual dress is more formal than in many other countries. Always dress elegantly and err on the side of over-dressing rather than under-dressing.</li>
 <li>If you did not bring a gift to the hostess, flowers the next day are always appreciated. </li>
 <li>Be prepared for lengthy meals (two hours or more for lunch). Do not discuss business during meals unless your host brings it up. Business may occasionally be discussed at dinner in S&atilde;o Paulo or Rio.
</li>

</ul>


<a id="Misc"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Gifts</h3>
<ul>
 <li>If invited to a Brazilian&#39;s house, bring the hostess flowers or a small gift.</li>
 <li>Orchids are considered a very nice gift, but avoid purple ones.</li>
 <li>Avoid giving anything purple or black as these are mourning colours.</li>
 <li>Handkerchiefs are also associated with funerals, so they do not make good gifts.</li>
 <li>Gifts are opened when received.</li>
</ul>
