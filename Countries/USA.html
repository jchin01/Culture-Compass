<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When greeting someone in America, it is ideal to offer to shake hands as this is the form in which we say hello.</li>
  <li>American people do not like too little space between themselves and their speaking partners, and they do not like to touch or be touched while having a conversation.</li>
  <li>If we see Americans who form a circle with their thumb and index finger, they refer to something good, this signal means "OK," "yes," or "fine".</li>
  <li>Yawning means tiredness, boredom, and it is impolite.</li>
  <li>High five means "congratulations."</li>
  <li>Rubbing the hands together means that the person is cold or feels impatient anticipation.</li>
  <li>Another generally used gesture is whistling which is quite often used at sport events, performances, to gain attention from someone, or watching a pretty woman in the street.</li>
  <li>In America, a thumbs up actually signifies "good job" or approval of something.</li>
  <li>Do not stick out a middle finger as it expresses hatred for someone and is considered extremely offensive.</li>
  <li>While in other countries tips are considered offensive due to the fact it may seem as an added incentive for doing their job, in America, tips are given out generously.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Table Manners </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Arriving Late is expected as Americans usually run behind schedule and the standard.</li>
