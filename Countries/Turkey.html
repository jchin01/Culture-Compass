<a id="Communication"></a>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In some rural areas, where religion has more of an influence over everyday customs and behaviour, women and men are expected to keep some distance apart in public. Therefore handholding, hugging, and kissing are not undertaken. Even handshakes and eye contact between the sexes may be avoided.</li>

  <li> However in more urban locations, this is much more relaxed and there is a lot of integration between men and women. Handshakes and a kiss on each cheek between men and women are common forms of meeting and greeting. </li>

  <li>It is common for Turkish men and women to cheek-kiss one another when meeting and parting.</li>
  <li>"Yes" is a slight downward nod of the head. "No" is a slight upward nod of the head while making a quick sucking sound through your two front teeth (like "tsk").</li>
  <li>Turks generally have a small area of personal space and may stand closer than most foreigners are used to.</li>
  <li>Never point the sole of your foot toward a person.</li>
  <li>Turks, most of whom are devout Muslims, may avoid looking into your eyes in a display of humble behavior.</li>
  <li>Do not stand with your hands on your hips when talking to others, especially older people or superiors, or put your hands in your pockets.</li>
  <li>In Turkey, putting your thumb between your first two fingers is the equivalent to raising your middle finger in the United States.</li>
  <li>The "O.K." sign in Turkey means that someone is homosexual.</li>
  <li>"No" is indicated by a nod of the head upwards, often with raised eyebrows or a sharp intake of air through the front teeth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Table Manners </h2>
<ul>
  <li>If invited into a Turkish person&#39;s home, the proper etiquette is to bring a gift with you to show your humbleness and gratitude. Small decorative pieces, sweets, and pastries are the most common gifts, and you should remember to include children when offering gifts </li>
  <li>Be punctual for a dinner party. 7:00 p.m. means 7:00 p.m.</li>
  <li>Business can be discussed at anytime during the meal, but you must get a feel from your business counterpart.</li>
  <li>Some Turks who are Muslim drink alcohol, but those Turks who are strict Muslims never do.</li>
  <li>Hosts will probably expect you to eat a great deal and may be offended if you don&#39;t.</li>
  <li>When finished eating, leave no food on your plate and place your knife and fork side by side on your plate.</li>
  <li>Dutch treat" does not exist in Turkey. If you invite someone to dine, you pay the bill.</li>

</ul>


<a id="Misc"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Gifts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gift giving has no real place in business relationships or etiquette. Relationship building and the like will usually take the form of dining or sight seeing trips rather than lavish gifts.
</li>
  <li>However, if a gift is given it will be accepted well. It is always a good idea to bring gifts from your own country such as food stuffs or craft items.
</li>
  <li>Be aware that Turkey is a Muslim country. Before giving alcohol to anyone be 100% sure that they drink.
</li>
  <li>The only time you would need to give any great thought to gifts would be if you were invited to a Turk&#39;s home for dinner. The most usual gifts to take are pastries (especially &#39;baklava&#39;), and decorative items for the home such as ornaments or vases. Flowers are not usually taken to a host, but they can be if it is appropriate. It is best to ask a florist for advice on what is best to take. If the host has children take some expensive sweets or candy.
</li>
</ul>
