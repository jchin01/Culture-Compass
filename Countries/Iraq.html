<a id="Communication"></a>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The standard Arabic/Islamic greeting is "asalaamu alaikum" (peace be with you) to which the response is "wa alaikum salaam" (and peace be unto you). </li>

  <li> Good friends of the same sex may greet each other with a handshake and a kiss on each cheek (starting with the right). </li>

  <li>Expect to be introduced to each person individually at a small social function. At a large function, you may introduce yourself.</li>

<li>The need to save face and protect honour means that showing emotions is seen negatively. Displays of anger are a serious no-no. If you must show disapproval, it is always best to do so in a one-to-one, quietly and with tact.
</li>

</ul>

<a id="TableManners"></a>
<h2>Table Manners </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Iraqi table manners are relatively formal.
</li>
  <li>If the meal is on the floor, sit cross-legged or kneel on one knee. Never let your feet touch the food mat.
</li>
  <li>Use the right hand for eating and drinking.
</li>
  <li>It is considered polite to leave some food on your plate when you have finished eating.
</li>

</ul>


<a id="Misc"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Gifts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you are invited to an Iraqi home, bring a box of cookies, pastries, or a box of chocolates. A fruit basket is also appreciated. Flowers are being given more and more, but only to a hostess.
</li>
  <li>If a man must give a gift to a woman, he should say that it is from his wife, mother, sister, or some other female relation.
</li>
  <li>Gifts are given with two hands.
</li>
  <li>Gifts are generally not opened when received.
</li>

</ul>
