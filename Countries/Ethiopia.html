<a id="Communication"></a>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ethiopians can be very sensitive when it comes to communication. Since they have only recently begun working with foreigners in business situations they are still getting used to new ways of doing business and communicating.
</li>

  <li>  They generally speak in soft tones. Loud voices are seen as too aggressive. </li>

  <li>Ethiopians pride themselves on their eloquent speaking style and expect others to speak clearly and use metaphors, allusions, and witty innuendos. They often use exaggerated phrases to emphasize a point.</li>
  <li>As a rule, Ethiopians tend to be non-confrontational and offer what they believe is the expected response rather than say something that might embarrass another. Honour and dignity are crucial to Ethiopians and they will go out of their way to keep from doing something that could bring shame to another person.</li>
  <li>Ethiopian business colleagues act with utmost professionalism and never do anything that would make them lose dignity and respect.
</li>

</ul>

<a id="TableManners"></a>
<h2>Table Manners </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ethiopians are relatively formal and believe table manners are a sign of respect. Do not presume that because food is eaten with the hands, there is a lack of decorum.
 </li>
  <li>Expect a small earthenware or metal jug to be brought to the table before the meal is served. Extend your hands over the basin while water is poured over them.
</li>
  <li>Only use the right hand for eating.</li>
  <li>Hierarchy dictates that the eldest person is the first to take food from the communal plate.
</li>
  <li>Guests are often served tasty morsels by another guest in a process called "gursa." Using thier hands, the person places the morsel in the other person&#39;s mouth. Since this is done out of respect, it is a good idea to smile and accept the offering</li>
  <li>Expect to be urged to take more food. Providing an abundance of food is a sign of hospitality.
</li>
  <li>The meal ends with ritual hand-washing and coffee.
</li>

</ul>


<a id="Misc"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Gifts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gifts may be given to celebrate events of significance or religious occasions. Since Ethiopia is an extremely poor country, expensive gifts are not the norm.
</li>
  <li>Giving a gift that is too expensive may be viewed negatively. It may be seen as an attempt to garner influence or it may embarrass the recipient as they will not be able to match it in kind.</li>
  <li>If you are invited to an Ethiopian&#39;s home, bring pastries, fruit, or flowers to the host. A small gift for the children is always appreciated.

</li>
  <li>Do not bring alcohol unless you know that your host drinks. Most Muslims and Amharic people do not.

</li>
  <li>Gifts are not opened when received. Gifts are given with two hands or the right hand only - never the left hand.
</li>
</ul>
