<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Greetings are warm and friendly. People kiss business acquaintances on the cheek once and personal friends twice.</li>
  <li>Handshakes are common among strangers.
</li>
  <li>Venezuelans stand very close when speaking. Do not back away.
</li>
  <li>Seating posture is important. Try to keep both feet on the floor and avoid slouching. Don&#39;t put your feet on furniture.
</li>
  <li>Casual touching is common among males.
</li>
  <li>The "ch-ch" sound is used to get someone&#39;s attention or to get a bus to stop.
 </li>
  <li>The North American "O.K." sign is extremely rude.
</li>
  <li>Pointing with your index finger can be considered rude. Motioning with your entire hand is more polite.
</li>
  <li>Always maintain eye contact when talking.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Table Manners </h2>
<ul>

  <li>Never decline an offer of coffee as it is a symbol of hospitality to Venezuelans. </li>
 <li>The host saying "buen provecho" (enjoy or have a good meal) is the customary invitation for everyone to eat.
</li>
  <li>In most cases, a maid or server will place food on your platey

     although large dinner parties may be buffet style.
 </li>
  <li>Wait for a toast to be made before taking the first sip of your drink. Venezuelans typically toast with the word "salud" (health).
</li>
  <li>The host makes the first toast.
 </li>
  <li>When not using utensils, rest the tips on the edge of the plate with the handles resting on the table.
 </li>
  <li>When you have finished eating, place your knife and fork diagonally across the plate with the prongs facing down and the handles facing to the right.
 </li>
</ul>


<a id="Misc"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Gifts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Always bring a gift when visiting someone&#39;s home. A gift for the children will be appreciated. A little dress or teddy bear would be appropriate.
</li>
  <li>White, gold, and silver are popular colors for any gift.
 </li>
  <li>Send flowers before a social occasion. The orchid is the national flower.
</li>
<li>Many Venezuelans like scotch. Give high-quality scotch (Johnny Walker Black Label, Chivas Regal), or wine.
</li>
<li>Do not give gifts in business until a personal relationship has been established.
</li>

</ul>
