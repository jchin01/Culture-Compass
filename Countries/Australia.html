<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Australians are not very formal so greetings are casual and relaxed.

</li>
  <li> A handshake and smile suffices.
</li>
  <li>While an Australian may say, "G&#39;day" or "G&#39;day, mate," this may sound patronizing from a foreigner.

</li>
  <li>Visitors should simply say, "Hello" or "Hello, how are you?"
</li>
  <li>Aussies prefer to use first names, even at the initial meeting.

</li>
  <li>Don&#39;t comment on anyone&#39;s accent. Accents often distinguish social class.
</li>
  <li>Do not sniff or blow your nose in public.
</li>
<li>The "V" sign (made with index and middle fingers, palm facing inward) is a very vulgar gesture. The "thumbs up" gesture is also considered obscene.
</li>
  <li>When yawning, cover your mouth and excuse yourself.
</li>
  <li>Avoid discussions about the treatment of the aboriginal people.
</li>


</ul>

<a id="TableManners"></a>
<h2>Table Manners </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Many invitations to an Aussie&#39;s home will be for a "barbie" (BBQ).
</li>
  <li>Guests to a barbeque typically bring wine or beer for their personal consumption. In some cases, very informal barbecues may suggest that you bring your own meat!
</li>
  <li> Arrive on time if invited to dinner; no more than 15 minutes late if invited to a barbeque or a large party.
</li>
  <li>Contact the hostess ahead of time to see if she would like you to bring a dish.
 </li>
  <li>Offer to help the hostess with the preparation or clearing up after a meal is served.
 </li>
  <li>Table manners are Continental -- hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right while eating.

</li>
  <li> Indicate you have finished eating by laying your knife and fork parallel on your plate with the handles facing to the right.
</li>
  <li> Keep your elbows off the table and your hands above the table when eating.
</li>

</ul>


<a id="Misc"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Gifts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Small gifts are commonly exchanged with family members, close friends, and neighbours on birthdays and Christmas.</li>
  <li>Trades people such as sanitation workers may be given a small amount of cash, or more likely, a bottle of wine or a six-pack of beer!</li>
  <li>If invited to someones home for dinner, it is polite to bring a box of chocolates or flowers to the hostess. A good quality bottle of wine is always appreciated.</li>
  <li>Gifts are opened when received.</li>

</ul>
