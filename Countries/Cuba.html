<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Men shake hands when greeting one another and usually maintain direct eye contact. Handshakes may linger. Good friends and family will engage in a firm hug which may be combined with a few slaps on the back. </li>
  <li>At a first meeting, women generally shake hands. Friends and close acquaintances kiss each other once on the cheek. </li>
  <li> Cubans tend to be direct and some what louder than what the norm is in North America.
</li>
  <li>Cubans prefer standing close to one another while talking with someone they know. One to two feet is normal, but when meeting strangers, this distance is farther.
</li>
  <li>There is a fair amount of touching between people while conversing (between men and men, women and women, and men and women).
</li>
  <li> Cubans tend to speak very quickly and loudly. They use their hands and bodies for emphasis when speaking and tend to be emotionally expressive.
</li>
  <li> Cubans will point by puckering their lips in the direction or person they are referring to.
</li>
  <li>Wrinkling or scrunching up of your nose usually means, "huh" or "what?".
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Table Manners </h2>
<ul>

  <li> If eating in a nice restaurant or a local&#39;s home, dress a little nicer than you otherwise would especially if dining with a business colleague. Try to arrive on time, but remember many locals will arrive up to 15 minutes late.</li>
 <li> When guests are present, hosts will usually make a point of offering second helpings, but it is acceptable to decline.</li>
  <li>The meal may begin with a toast, the most common toast being "salud" (health) and the meal will begin with the words "buen provecho" (have a good time eating).</li>
  <li>While eating use the continental style (knife in the right hand, fork in the left) for all foods, including fruits; keep your hands in sight be resting your wrists on the edge of the table. </li>
  <li> Once you are finished eating, place your fork and knife together on the right side of your plate to indicate you are finished.</li>
</ul>


<a id="Misc"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Attire</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The dress code in Cuba is relatively casual because of its level of development combined with its tropical (humid) Caribbean climate.</li>
  <li>Shorts and bikinis are appropriate at the beach, particularly if in a resort or more touristy area. In general, Cubans dress according to the climate though not overly provocative. </li>
  <li>Shorts or light trousers with short sleeve shirts or tank tops are generally fine.</li>

</ul>
