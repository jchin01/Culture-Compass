<a id="Communication"></a>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
  <li>There are several greeting styles in South Africa depending upon the ethnic heritage of the person you are meeting.
</li>

  <li>When dealing with foreigners, most South Africans shake hands while maintaining eye contact and smiling.
 </li>

  <li>Some women do not shake hands and merely nod their head, so it is best to wait for a woman to extend her hand.
</li>
  <li>Men may kiss a woman they know well on the cheek in place of a handshake. Greetings are leisurely and include time for social discussion and exchanging pleasantries.
</li>

</ul>

<a id="TableManners"></a>
<h2>Table Manners </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Arrive on time if invited to dinner.
</li>
  <li>Contact the hostess ahead of time to see if she would like you to bring a dish.
</li>
  <li>Wear casual clothes. This may include jeans or pressed shorts. It is a good idea to check with the hosts in advance.
</li>
  <li>In Johannesburg, casual is dressier than in other parts of the country. Do not wear jeans or shorts unless you have spoken to the hosts.
</li>
  <li>Offer to help the hostess with the preparation or clearing up after a meal is served.
</li>

</ul>


<a id="Misc"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Gifts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In general, South Africans give gifts for birthdays and Christmas.
</li>
  <li>Two birthdays - 21 and 40 - are often celebrated with a large party in which a lavish gift is given. It is common for several friends to contribute to this gift to help defray the cost.
</li>
  <li>If you are invited to a South African&#39;s home, bring flowers, good quality chocolates, or a bottle of good South African wine to the hostess.
</li>
  <li>Wrapping a gift nicely shows extra effort.
</li>
  <li>Gifts are opened when received.
</li>
</ul>
