<h1>About Us</h1>
<div class="quote">"The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page."<br>- Saint Augustine</div>

<p>Our mission is to provide information about different cultures across the world. We strive to become more culturally aware of the different traditions and customs in each culture. Our goal is to connect society one click at a time. We hope to unite society with our website, and break the cultural divide that restricts our unity as a race.</p>

<p>Even amongst a small group of five, there lies a multitude of different backgrounds. Although we come from across the globe, we find that within each of our distinctive cultures comes a form of etiquette - a code for formal behavior.</p>

<p>We believe that by stepping into the shoes of those around us - by taking it upon ourselves to learn about others&#39; way of living- we become more connected. The effort doesn&#39;t go unnoticed. Rather, the action in itself strengthens a sense of community.</p>

<p>This website was designed for that purpose. We strive to unite society one click at a time. </p>
